# MR atrophy synthesis using convolutional neural networks via latent space representation

## Requirements
### Libraries
The pipeline has been implemented under the following configuration

- fsl == 5.0
- h5py == 2.7.0
- ipython == 5.3.0
- jupyter == 1.0.0
- keras == 2.1.4
- nibabel == 2.2.1
- nipype == 0.12.1
- python == 2.7.12
- scipy == 1.0.0
- scikit-image == 0.13.0
- scikit-learn == 0.18.1
- tensorflow == 1.4.0
- tensorflow-gpu == 1.4.0

## How to run it

The pipeline implementation is contained in the "atrophy generation" notebook. To run our implementation, the first step is to run the following command on the main folder:
```
jupyter notebook
```
